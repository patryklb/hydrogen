# Quantum mechanical analysis of H2 molecule
This repository contains Source codes developed for my B.E thesis. I tried to 

hl: mathematica scripts which use Heitler-London method to find approximate value of the H2 bonding energy. Uses Monte Carlo integration for interaction integrals.

hf: c++ code implementing hartee-fock method for H2 molecule. Requires LAPACK library to run.

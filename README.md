# Quantum mechanical analysis of H2 molecule
The repository contains source codes developed for my B.E thesis. Enjoy :) 

##hl: 
mathematica scripts which use Heitler-London method to find approximate value of the H2 bonding energy. Uses Monte Carlo integration for interaction integrals.

##hf: 
c++ code implementing hartee-fock method for H2 molecule. Requires LAPACK library to run.
